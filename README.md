# ScottCo-Chamber
The source code for a proposed redesign to the Chamber of Commerce page.
# Proposal
This website was written to become a Wordpress theme for the Scott County Chamber of Commerce website. The initial site was created in HTML and CSS, as an interactive design. The design, being fully functional as is, would then be broken up and converted in a [Wordpress](wordpress.org) theme. 
# Deployment
The project was created through a leadership program at Scottsburg High School. Unfortunately the project was cancelled and full deployment was never achieved. However, the source code and website are still visible to view. The website itself is no longer maintained.
